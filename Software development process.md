###  Software development process

#### Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
Planning -> Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Maintenance  
It describes an iterative process of software development in normal situationS.
And people came up with serveral differernt models to help technical teams develop softwares based on the conception of SDLC.

#### Waterfall Model
Requirements -> Design -> Implementation -> Verification -> Maintenance  
It looks like a one-way street and there is no chance of turing back. 
People who is going to use that model should strictly follow the workflow step by step as expected.
Even through the fact is some modified waterfall models might be preferred nowadays, 
but still, the model is not as flexible as the some other models, like Agile.

#### Agile Model
iteration1: planning -> requirements analysis -> designing -> building -> testing  
iteration2: repeat...  
iteration2: repeat...  
It may look like an iterative waterfall model. But there are more differences into details.  
In Agile conception, people usually talk about a word "Scrum", which is more like a methodology of Agile.
Each iteration in Scrum is called sprint, it might last for a week or a month, which depents on your Scrum plan.
There will be roles including Scrum owner(who represents the client), Scrum Master(who is responsible for communicating with Scrum owner) and Scrum Team(who will be working on developing products).
More details, a Sprint Planning Meeting will be hold by Scrum Master before each sprint for elaborating the plan and responsibilities of team members.
Also, there will be Review Meetings and Retrospective Meetings for reviewing things that have been done so far. 
Most requirements or work that should be done or going to be done will be documented clearly on Kanban(for example, I used it when I was learning Scrum).

Basically, compare to Waterfall model, Agile is more flexible not only because it has many sprints which makes things much easier to backtrack, 
but also the whole structure of the model enable more communications and closer corperation either between clients and Team master or each teammembers.
